Ticket API - Authentication System with Nodemailer

Authentication System with OTP via Nodemailer
The authentication system in this project uses OTP (One-Time Password) sent via email. It utilizes Gmail service and the Nodemailer library.

Required Environment Variables

GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com  # Gmail account for sending emails
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password  # Application-specific password
Guide to Set Up Gmail for Email Sending
To use Gmail service for sending OTP emails, follow these steps:

Enable Two-Factor Authentication:

Log in to your Gmail account

Go to Security settings

Under "Signing in to Google", enable "2-Step Verification"

Create an App Password:

After enabling 2FA, go to App passwords

Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" as the device

Enter a name for your application (e.g., "Ticket API")

Click "Generate" to get your 16-digit app password

Configure Environment Variables:

Set GMAIL_USER to your full Gmail address

Set GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD to the generated app password (not your main Gmail password)

Security Considerations:

Never commit your actual credentials to version control

Consider using a dedicated email account for sending application emails

For production, consider using a professional SMTP service like SendGrid or Mailgun

Implementation Details
The authentication flow works as follows:

User requests OTP by providing email (/api/v1/user/get-otp)

System generates a 6-digit OTP and stores it with expiration time

OTP is sent to user's email via Nodemailer

User submits OTP for verification (/api/v1/user/check-otp)

System validates OTP and issues JWT token upon success

Troubleshooting
If emails aren't being sent:

Verify 2FA is enabled

Confirm app password was generated correctly

Check Gmail's SMTP server limits (500 emails/day for free accounts)

Review server logs for error messages

Test with less secure apps enabled (temporarily) if needed

For production environments, we recommend migrating to a dedicated email service provider for better deliverability and higher sending limits.
